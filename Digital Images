Bitmap vs Vector graphics:

  Adobe photoshop - Bitmap
    When Bitmap is scaled up, you will see the pixels or blocks used to make up the image
    
  Adobe Illustrator - Vector Images
    When vector is scaled up it will remain smooth, because an image like a circle is defined as a shape and is represented as a math construct
    
Color Depth(Bit depth):

   Number of bits used to indicate color of a certain pixel
    Each pixel in a bitmap image is represented by a number of bits.
     24 bit (True Color)(24^2) - 16,777,216 possible colors
        Uses 24 bits (3 bytes) for each pixel
          1 byte (8 bits) is assigned to each red, blue, and green
            8 bits of each color makes 256 possible shades of the certain color (red, blue, green)

    16 bit (High Color)(16^2) - 65536 possible colors
    8 bit (Indexed Color)(8^2) - 256 possible colors
 
Image Compression: 
 
  Type of data compression having to do with images to reduce storage space
    Lossy compression:
      Supported by JPEG, each time the image is saved, you could lose information, which makes your image have less quality.
    Lossless compression:
      Supported by PNG, will not lose any information when saved multiple times which results in the image still being the same quality when first saved
      
Best file types for web pages:
  JPEG, GIF, PNG, SVG and WEBP
  
File types to not use on web pages:
  BMP, TIFF, and XBM
